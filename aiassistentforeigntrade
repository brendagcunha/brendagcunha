# Implementing and Evaluating an AI-Assisted Public Helpdesk in Foreign Trade Administration

## Purpose
This repository documents the design and evaluation of a public sector AI assistant created to respond to regulatory and procedural questions in foreign trade administration.

The project analyses a hybrid service model where:
- an AI agent provides first-level answers to users
- human analysts provide specialised and high-risk guidance

The objective is to assess efficiency gains, risks, and governance requirements when introducing AI into administrative advisory services.

---

## Public Problem
Public administrations handling complex regulation receive a large volume of repetitive information requests.

Traditional helpdesks face:
- high response time
- inconsistent interpretations
- heavy workload on specialised staff
- difficulty scaling services

AI-based assistants can improve accessibility and speed, but introduce legal and governance challenges.

---

## Service Model
Hybrid advisory model:

User → AI Assistant → (resolved)  
                        ↘ Human analyst (complex or sensitive cases or dissatisfaction of the user)

The AI does not replace the civil servant.  
It acts as a triage and standard information layer.

## What This Project Evaluates
### Administrative Efficiency
- response time reduction
- volume of human tickets avoided
- workload redistribution

### Quality of Answers
- legal and procedural accuracy
- completeness of information
- consistency across similar questions

### Risk & Governance
- incorrect regulatory guidance
- user misinterpretation
- accountability allocation
- auditability of automated answers

---

## Methodology
The evaluation is based on:
1. Service design analysis
2. KPI framework for public helpdesks
3. Comparative assessment: human vs AI responses
4. Risk classification by type of question
5. Governance recommendations

---

## Expected Outcomes
AI assistants are most effective when:
- handling informational queries
- guiding users through procedures
- standardising public information

Human experts remain essential for:
- interpretation of specific cases
- legal responsibility
- discretionary decisions

---

## Policy Relevance
This project contributes to discussions on:
- trustworthy AI in government
- administrative digitalisation
- service scalability
- human-in-the-loop governance models
